## Description <br>

### User Story:

```
AS A developer
I WANT a README generator
SO THAT I can quickly create a professional README for a new project
```

```
GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input
WHEN I am prompted for information about my application repository
THEN a high-quality, professional README.md is generated with the title of my project and sections entitled Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions
WHEN I enter my project title
THEN this is displayed as the title of the README
WHEN I enter a description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions
THEN this information is added to the sections of the README entitled Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, and Tests
WHEN I choose a license for my application from a list of options
THEN a badge for that license is added near the top of the README and a notice is added to the section of the README entitled License that explains which license the application is covered under
WHEN I enter my GitHub username
THEN this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with a link to my GitHub profile
WHEN I enter my email address
THEN this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with instructions on how to reach me with additional questions
WHEN I click on the links in the Table of Contents
THEN I am taken to the corresponding section of the README
```

## Installation

Users will need to install the following in their command line:
```
npm i
```


## Usage

After the installation process, users will then need to run the following in their command line:
```
node index.js
```
This will start the generator process for the users. Once they have answered the prompts to the best of their ability, a new file called, "GenREADME.md" will be created in the main folder. They are encouraged to further add to their README's to dress things up as much as the would like!
